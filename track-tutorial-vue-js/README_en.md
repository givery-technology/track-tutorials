# Vue (TypeScript) template
This is a template for taking frontend challenges using Vue (TypeScript).
Follow the instructions in the tutorial question to build and submit your Vue application on Track. 

#### **Notes**
This repository was bootstrapped with the [Vue CLI](https://cli.vuejs.org/guide/creating-a-project.html).
It is **not a must** to use this template to solve frontend challenges on Track. Any UI framework or library can be used. The final product that needs to be submitted is the build files.
This template is confirmed to work with `node` version `14.17.0` and `npm` version `6.14.13`.

## Available commands
The following commands can be executed in the directory of this repository.

### `npm install`

### `npm run`
This command runs your application in development mode. After it is run, open [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) to see your application in the browser. To make changes to your application, edit the files under the `src` directory.

### `npm run build`
This command creates a production build of the application and saves it in the `build` directory.
To submit your answer on Track, the build files need to be updated.
